**Teaching Philosophy Statement**

I've been a lecturer for about seven years, but my background isn't strictly academic. Instead, Iâ€™ve spent six years running a design studio in China then worked as a contractor for various agencies and clients. This independent path traces back to my teenage years in the 80s, growing up in the DIY scene of my hometown in southern France. Being part of a group of like-minded friends immersed in punk-rock, early hip-hop, remixing, electronic music, and free parties taught me the value of creativity, reappropriation, and community. I aim to bring these influences into the classroom, hoping my classes do more than just deliver theoretical knowledgeâ€”they inspire students to innovate, experiment, and take charge of their creative journeys. Big goal for 2025 ðŸ˜Š

**Disciplinary Identity and Its Influence**

My journey with Machine Learning and AI began during my MA in design about ten years ago. Watching the rise of the generative AI movement, I've seen how these tools have become integral to our daily lives. The resourcefulness and innovation from both researchers and early adopters remind me a lot of the DIY spirit. The creative process here mirrors remix culture, where taking existing materials and creating something new is key. Generative AI in art and design operates similarly, allowing artists to tweak and evolve digital content, fostering a cycle of creativity and personalization. This highlights the need for cultural curation and creative autonomy. By integrating these ideas into the curriculum, I encourage students to see AI not just as a tool but as a collaborative partner in their creative workflows, echoing the DIY ethos that's been central to artistic expression.

**Goals as a Teacher**

My goals as an educator are:

1. **Empower Creativity with AI:** Help students use AI tools creatively in their design projects.
2. **Enhance Critical Thinking:** Emphasize the importance of critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
3. **Foster Inclusivity and Collaboration:** Create a classroom environment that welcomes diverse ideas and opinions.

Bridging the gap between theory and practice is crucial, aligning perfectly with our mission as a Technical University. This ensures students can seamlessly integrate AI into their creative processes.

**Approach to Teaching**

In practice, I focus on active learning strategies like Project-Based Learning (PBL) and Peer Instruction. This means students are constantly engaged and gaining hands-on experience. For example, they might develop AI-driven art pieces, applying machine learning concepts to real creative tasks. The syllabus includes real-world challenges and group assignments to build both technical skills and creative research abilities. Feedback is a two-way street: I provide specific feedback on projects and encourage peer reviews to support a collaborative learning environment. Additionally, I regularly collect student feedback through anonymous online questionnaires to adjust the class structure and content as needed.

**Strengths and Commitment to Growth**

One of my strengths is blending technical knowledge with creative application, helping students make the most of AI tools in their artistic projects. I stay updated with the latest AI advancements alongside my students, treating it as a collective learning journey. When new developments arise, I incorporate them into the curriculum to keep our material current and relevant.

**Conclusion: Vision for Teaching**

My teaching philosophy is all about combining active learning with the latest AI tools to create a dynamic and inclusive classroom. By drawing from remix culture and leveraging generative models, I prepare students to navigate and contribute to the ever-changing world of art and design. My goal is to inspire a new generation of innovative thinkers and skilled practitioners who use AI to push the boundaries of creativity and expression.
