## Content

- Touching base
- [:question: Tools](https://digitalideation.github.io/digcre_h2401/slides/week02.html)
- Intro to tools: [Keras](https://keras.io/) / [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- First steps with Colab / Jupyter
- Other tools
  - HF
  - Replicate
  - TBA

## Goal

The goal this week is to:

1. Start using Colab / Pytorch / Keras
2. Getting familiar with the many different ways we can interact with models
3. :rotating_light: Make a poster image for our Discord :rotating_light:

## Preparation work

Practice your (Python?) skills, do some research for more tools / ideas.
