## Intro

This week, we dive into Large Language Models (LLMs). Your task is to explore how LLMs can remix ideas—just like we did with image generation last week—bringing fresh twists to classic design concepts.

## Schedule

| Time     | Desc                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 5 mins   | Touch base                                  |
| 120 mins | Watch video on LLMs                         |
| 10 mins  | Write a short, informal reflection          |
| 20 mins  | Experiment with Mistral and image prompting |
| 10 mins  | Share your findings on Slack                |

## Content

- **LLM Video:** Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI) to get an in depth explanation of LLMs mechanisms. Watch the first 2h.
- **Reflection:** In 150 words or more, write a casual summary of what grabbed your attention in the video—what surprised you, or what made you think that this could really change the way we work.
- **Tool Exploration:** Combine what we learned last week about image generation with new ideas from LLM prompting. Use Mistral (or some other LLMs) to generate creative prompts that can inspire visual designs. Use those prompts / ideas on Replicate to create an image. You can experiment with remixing a classic design idea using these prompts, and take it from there.
- **Discussion:** Post your reflection and results on Slack, we will discuss this next week.

## Goal

The goal this week is to:

- Understand the basics of LLMs and see how they can be used for creative work and design at large.
- Reflect on the creative potential of these tools in an informal, personal way.
- Connect image generation work with creative prompting.

## Preparation Work

- Watch the provided [LLM video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI).
- Experiment with LLMs for creative prompting—combine it with techniques from our image generation session.
- Prepare a short, informal written reflection and be ready to discuss your ideas.
